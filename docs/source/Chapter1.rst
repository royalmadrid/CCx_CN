With the energy crisis of the early 1970s came the realization that buildings could be
made more efficient without sacrificing comfort. Over the last 30 years, the building
industry has made revolutionary changes: chiller systems have decreased their
power requirements by a factor of two, from more than 1 kW/ton to less than 0.5
kW/ton; the use of variable air volume systems has become common practice; and
the use of building automation systems has become the norm, with digital controls
increasingly replacing pneumatics. Advances in HVAC technology have greatly improved
building comfort and significantly decreased building energy consumption.
The technological advances have increased the importance of proper operational
practices in achieving the efficiency potential of the HVAC systems. While reducing
energy use is a noble goal, it must not compromise comfort. Occupant comfort
and productivity must be maintained or improved.

    **Building commissioning has emerged as the preferred method of ensuring that
    building systems are installed and operated to provide the performance envisioned
    by the designer.**

Building commissioning has emerged as the preferred method of ensuring that
building systems are installed and operated to provide the performance envisioned
by the designer. ASHRAE has detailed the commissioning process in Guideline
1-1996 [ASHRAE 1996]. A number of other building commissioning guidelines
have been developed by different organizations, with the same basic objective as
the ASHRAE guideline, i.e., to ensure proper operation of the building according
to the design intent.

In 1999, DOE developed a practical guide for commissioning existing buildings
[Haasl and Sharp 1999]. Several building commissioning processes are discussed
in this guide. These processes include: new building commissioning, existing building
commissioning or retro-commissioning, Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` and recommissioning.
While most commissioning processes focus on bringing building
operation to the original design intent, Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` is different [1]_.
Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` (CC  :sup:`SM`) focuses on optimizing HVAC system operation
and control for the existing building conditions. This is an important distinction.
Based on Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` results from more than 130 buildings,
the average measured utility savings are about 20%, with simple paybacks often in
less than two years. These results are based on the experience of the Texas Engineering
Experiment Station’s Energy Systems Laboratory at Texas A&M University
during the last 10 years [Liu et al. 1994, Claridge et al. 1994, Liu et al. 1999,
Claridge et al. 2000]. Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` maintains long-term savings
by ongoing monitoring of energy savings with followup commissioning, as needed;
improves the system reliability and building comfort by optimizing system operation
and control schedules based on actual building conditions; upgrades the operating
staff’s skills by allowing direct participation of O&M staff; and reduces O&M
costs.

*This chapter defines* |CCSM|  *and provides an introduction to the* |CCSM| *process. The
detailed objectives, methods, and procedures are discussed for each step of the* |CCSM|
*process. This discussion includes the major goals of each step, the methods needed
to achieve the specific goals and the procedures needed to conduct* |CCSM| *wisely and
efficiently.*

1.1 定义
---------------

Continuous Commissioning  :sup:`SM` (CC  :sup:`SM`) is an ongoing process to resolve operating problems,
improve comfort, optimize energy use and identify retrofits for existing commercial and
institutional buildings and central plant facilities.

CC  :sup:`SM` focuses on improving overall system control and operations for the building,
as it is currently utilized, and on meeting existing facility needs. It goes beyond an
operations and maintenance program. It does not ensure that the systems function as
originally designed, but ensures that the building and systems operate optimally to
meet the current requirements. During the CC  :sup:`SM` process, a comprehensive engineering
evaluation is conducted for both building functionality and system functions.
The optimal operational parameters and schedules are developed based on actual
building conditions and current occupancy requirements. An integrated approach is
used to implement these optimal schedules to ensure local and global system optimization
and persistence of the improved operational schedules.

.. sidebar:: **NOTE**

    The CC  :sup:`SM` team consists of a project manager, one or more CC  :sup:`SM` engineers and CC  :sup:`SM`
    technicians, and one or more designated members of the facility operating team.


The CC  :sup:`SM` team consists of a project manager, one or more CC  :sup:`SM` engineers and CC  :sup:`SM`
technicians [#]_, and one or more designated members of the facility operating team. The primary role of the project manager is to coordinate the activities of building
personnel and the commissioning team and schedule project progress. The project manager can be an owner representative or a CC  :sup:`SM` contractor representative. The
primary responsibilities of the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer are to:

* Develop metering and field measurement plans
* Develop improved operational and control schedules and set points
* Make necessary programming changes to the building automation system
* Supervise technicians implementing mechanical systems changes
* Estimate potential performance changes and energy savings
* Conduct an engineering analysis of the system changes
* Write a project report

The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should have the qualifications to perform the work specified.
The CC  :sup:`SM` technician will conduct field measurements and implement mechanical,
electrical, and control system program modifications and changes, under the direction
of the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer.

1.2 过程
-------------

The CC  :sup:`SM` process consists of two phases. The first phase is the project development
phase, that identifies the buildings and facilities to be included in the project
and develops the project scope. At the end of this phase, the CC  :sup:`SM` scope is clearly
defined and a CC  :sup:`SM` contract is signed. The second phase implements CC  :sup:`SM` and
verifies project performance.

This phase includes six steps:

* Develop the CC  :sup:`SM` plan and form the project team
* Develop performance baselines
* Conduct system measurements and develop CC  :sup:`SM` measures
* Implement CC  :sup:`SM` measures
* Document comfort improvements and energy savings
* Keep the commissioning continuous

**Phase 1: Project Development**

*Step 1: Identify Buildings or Facilities*

**Objective**

Screen potential CC  :sup:`SM` targets with minimal effort to identify buildings or facilities
that will receive a CC  :sup:`SM` audit. The CC  :sup:`SM` target can be a building, an entire facility,
or a piece of equipment. If the building is part of a complex or campus, it is desirable
to select the entire facility as the CC  :sup:`SM` target since one mechanical problem
may be rooted in another part of the building or facility.

**Method**

The initial CC  :sup:`SM` targets can be selected based on one or more of the following criteria:

* The target provides poor thermal comfort
* The target consumes excessive energy, and/or
* The design features of the facility HVAC systems are not fully used

If one or more of the above criteria fits the description of the facility, it is likely to
be a good candidate for CC  :sup:`SM`. CC  :sup:`SM` can be effectively implemented in buildings
that have received energy efficiency retrofits, in newer buildings, and in existing
buildings that have not received energy efficiency upgrades. In other words, virtually
any building can be a potential CC  :sup:`SM` candidate.

The CC  :sup:`SM` targets can be selected by the building owner or the CC  :sup:`SM` contractor.
However, the building owner is usually in the best position to select the most promising
targets because of his or her knowledge of the facility operation and costs.
The CC  :sup:`SM` contractor should then perform a preliminary assessment to check the
feasibility of using the CC  :sup:`SM` process on the target facilities before conducting a
CC  :sup:`SM` audit.

Information needed for preliminary assessment:

* Actual monthly utility bills (both electricity and gas) for at least 12 months 
  (preferable to just a table of historical energy and demand data because meter 
  reading dates are needed)
* General building information: size, function, major equipment, and occupancy
  schedules
* O&M records, if available
* Description of any problem in the building, such as thermal comfort, indoor air quality, moisture, mildew

An experienced engineer should review this information and determine the potential
of the CC  :sup:`SM` process to improve comfort and reduce energy cost. The CC  :sup:`SM` projects
often improve building comfort and reduce building energy consumption at the same
time. However, some of the CC  :sup:`SM` measures may increase building energy consumption
in order to satisfy room comfort and indoor air quality requirements. For example,
providing building minimum outside air will certainly increase the cooling
energy consumption during summer and winter than providing no outside air to the
building. If the potential justifies a CC  :sup:`SM` audit, a list of preliminary commissioning
measures for evaluation in a CC  :sup:`SM` audit should also be developed. If the owner is
interested in proceeding at this point, a CC  :sup:`SM` audit may be performed.

*Step 2: Perform CC  :sup:`SM` Audit and Develop Project Scope*

**Objectives**

* Define owner’s requirements
* Check the availability of in-house technical support such as CC  :sup:`SM` technicians
* Identify major CC  :sup:`SM` measures

**Method**

The owner’s representative, the CC  :sup:`SM` project manager and the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer will
meet. The expectations and interest of the building owner in comfort improvements,
utility cost reductions and maintenance cost reductions will be discussed and documented
in detail. The availability and technical skills of in-house technicians will
be discussed. After this discussion, a walkthrough must be conducted to identify
the feasibility of the owner’s expectations for comfort performance and improved
energy performance. During the walkthrough, major CC  :sup:`SM` measures will be identified
by the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer and project manager. An in-house technician should participate
in the walkthrough. The CC  :sup:`SM` project manager will organize the audit and
document the expectations of the building owner.

Special Considerations:

* A complete set of mechanical and control system design documentation is
  needed
* The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer and technician will take preliminary measurements of
  equipment operating parameters
* Any available measured whole building level or sub-metered energy
  consumption data from stand-alone meters or the building automation system
  should be utilized

A CC  :sup:`SM` audit report must be completed that lists and describes preliminary CC  :sup:`SM`
measures, the estimated energy savings from implementation and the cost of carrying
out the CC  :sup:`SM` process on the building(s) evaluated in the CC  :sup:`SM` audit.
There may be more than one iteration or variation at each step described here, but
once a contract is signed, the process moves to Phase 2 as detailed below.

.. sidebar:: **NOTE**

   System problems should be documented based on interviews with occupants and technical staff, combined
   with field observations and measurements.


**Phase 2: CC  :sup:`SM` Implementation and Verification**

*Step 1: Develop CC  :sup:`SM` plan and form the project team*

**Objective**

* Develop a detailed work plan
* Identify the entire project team
* Clarify the duties of each team member

**Method**

The CC  :sup:`SM` project manager and CC  :sup:`SM` project engineer develop a detailed work plan
for the project that includes major tasks, their sequence, time requirements and
technical requirements. The work plan is then presented to the building owner or
representative. During the meeting, the owner’s representative and in-house technicians
who will work on the project should be identified. If in-house technicians are
going to conduct measurements and system adjustments, additional time should be
included in the schedule unless they are to be dedicated full-time to the CC  :sup:`SM` project.
Typically, in-house technicians must continue their existing duties and cannot
devote full time to the CC  :sup:`SM` effort, which results in project delays. In-house staff
may also require additional training. The work plan may need to be modified, depending
on the availability and skill levels of in-house staff.

**Special Issues:**

* Availability of funding to replace/repair parts found broken
* Time commitment of in-house staff
* Training needs of in-house staff

**Deliverable:**

CC  :sup:`SM` report part 1: CC  :sup:`SM` plan that includes project scope and schedule, project team
and task duties of each team member.

*Step 2: Develop performance baselines*

**Objectives:**

* Document existing comfort conditions
* Document existing system conditions
* Document existing energy performance

**Method:**

Precisely document all known comfort problems in individual rooms resulting from
too much heating, cooling, noise, humidity, odors (especially from mold or mildew)
or lack of outside air. Also, identify the following HVAC system problems:

* Valve and damper hunting
* Disabled systems or components
* Operational problems
* Frequently replaced parts

An interview and walk-through may be required, although most of this information
is collected during the CC  :sup:`SM` audit and step 1. Room comfort problems should be
quantified using hand-held meters or portable data loggers. System problems should
be documented based on interviews with occupants and technical staff and combined
with field observations and measurements.

Baseline energy models of building performance are necessary if energy savings are
to be documented after commissioning the building. The baseline energy models can
be developed using one or more of the following types of data:

* Short-term measured data obtained from data loggers or the EMCS system
* Long-term hourly or 15-minute whole building energy data, such as whole
  building electricity, cooling and heating consumption, and/or
* Utility bills for electricity, gas and/or chilled or hot water

The whole building energy baseline models normally include whole building electricity,
cooling energy and heating energy models. These models are generally expressed
as functions of outside air temperature since both heating and cooling energy
are normally weather dependent. Any component baseline models should be represented
using the most relevant physical parameter(s) as the independent variable(s).

For example, the fan motor power should be correlated with the fan airflow and the
pump motor energy consumption should be correlated with water flow.
Short-term measured data are often the most cost-effective and accurate if the potential
savings from CC  :sup:`SM` measures are independent of the weather. For example, a
single true power measurement can be used to develop the baseline fan energy consumption
if the pulley were to be changed in a constant air volume system. Shortterm
data are useful to determine the baseline for specific pieces of equipment, but
are not reliable for baselining overall building energy use.

Long-term measurements are normally required since potential savings of CC  :sup:`SM`
measures are weather dependent. These measurements provide the most convincing
evidence of the impact of CC  :sup:`SM` projects. Long-term data also help in continuing
to detect/diagnose system faults during CC  :sup:`SM` follow-up. Although more costly than
short-term measured data, long-term data often produce additional savings, making
them the preferred data type. For example, unusual energy consumption patterns
can be identified easily using long-term, short-interval measured data. “Fixing”
these unusual patterns can result in significant energy savings. Generally speaking,
long-term interval data for electricity, gas and thermal usage are preferred.

.. sidebar:: **NOTE**

    Utility bills may be used to develop the energy-use baseline if the CC  :sup:`SM` process
    will result in energy savings that are a significant fraction (>15%) of baseline use,
    and if the building functions and use patterns will remain the same throughout the
    project.


The CC  :sup:`SM` engineers should provide the metering option(s) that meet the project requirements
to the building owner or representative. A metering method should be
selected from the options presented by the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer and a detailed metering
implementation plan developed. It may be necessary to hire a metering subcontractor
if an energy information system is installed prior to implementing the CC  :sup:`SM`
measures.

**Special Considerations:**

* Use the maintenance log to help identify major system problems
* Select a metering plan that suits the CC  :sup:`SM` goals and the facility needs
* Always consider and measure weather data as part of the metering plan
* Keep meters calibrated. When the EMCS system is used for metering, both
  sensors and transmitters should be calibrated using field measurements.

**Deliverables:**

CC  :sup:`SM` report part 2: Report on Current Building Performance, including current
energy performance, current comfort and system problems, and metering plans if
new meters are to be installed. Alternatively, if utility bills are used to develop the
baseline models, the report should include baseline energy models.

*Step 3: Conduct System Measurements and Develop Proposed* CC  :sup:`SM`
*Measures*

**Objectives:**

* Identify current operating schedules, set points, and problems
* Develop solutions to existing problems
* Develop improved operation and control schedules and set points
* Identify potential cost effective energy retrofit measures

**Method:**

The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should develop a detailed measurement cut-sheet for each major
system. The cut-sheet should list all parameters to be measured and all mechanical
and electrical parts to be checked. The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should also provide the technician
with measurement training if a local technician is used to perform system
measurements. The CC  :sup:`SM` technician should follow the procedures on the cut-sheets
to obtain the specified measurements using appropriate equipment.
The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer conducts an engineering analysis to develop solutions for the existing
problems; develops improved operation and control schedules and set points
for terminal boxes, air handling units (AHUs), exhaust systems, water and steam
distribution systems, heat exchangers, chillers, boilers and other components, as appropriate;
and identifies potential cost effective energy retrofit measures.

**Special Considerations:**

* Trend main operational parameters using the EMCS and compare with the
  measurements from the hand meters
* Print EMCS control sequences
* Verify system operation in the building and compare to EMCS schedules

**Deliverables:**

CC  :sup:`SM` report part 3: Existing System Conditions. This report includes:

* Existing control sequences and set points for all major equipment, such as AHU
  supply air temperatures, AHU supply static pressures, terminal box minimum
  airflow and maximum airflow values, water loop differential pressure set points
  and equipment on/off schedules
* List of disabled control sequences
* List of malfunctioning equipment and control devices
* Engineering solutions to the existing problems and a list of repairs required
* Improved control and operation sequences

*Step 4: Implement* CC  :sup:`SM` *Measures*

**Objectives:**

* Obtain approval for each CC  :sup:`SM` measure from the building owner’s
  representative prior to implementation
* Implement solutions to existing operational and comfort problems
* Implement and refine improved operation and control schedules

**Method:**

The CC  :sup:`SM` project manager and project engineer should present the engineering solutions
to existing problems and the improved operational and control schedules to
the building owner’s representative in one or more meetings. The in-house operating
staff should be invited to the meeting(s). All critical questions should be answered.
It is important, at this point, to get “buy-in” and approval from both the building
owner’s representative and the operating staff. The meeting(s) will decide the following
issues:

* Approval, modification or disapproval of each CC  :sup:`SM` measure
* Implementation sequence of CC  :sup:`SM` measures
* Implementation schedules

.. sidebar:: **NOTE**

    CC  :sup:`SM` implementation should start by solving existing problems. 


The existing comfort
and difficult control problems are the first priority of the occupants, operating
staff and facility owners. Solving these problems improves occupant comfort and
increases productivity. The economic benefits from comfort improvements are
sometimes higher than the energy cost savings, though less easily quantified. The
successful resolution of the existing problems can also earn trust in the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer
from the facility operating staff, facility management, and the occupants. This
can lead to the team receiving support in a variety of unexpected ways.

Implementation of the improved operation and control schedules should start at the
end of the comfort delivery system, such as at the terminal boxes, and end with the
central plant. This procedure provides benefits to the building occupants as quickly
as possible. It also reduces the overall working load. If the process is reversed, the
chiller plant is commissioned first. The chiller sequences are developed based on
the current load. After building commissioning, the chiller load may be decreased
by 30%. The chiller operating schedules are then likely to need revision.
The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should develop a detailed implementation plan that lists each
major activity. The CC  :sup:`SM` technician should follow this plan in implementing the
measures.

The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should closely supervise the implementation and refine the
operational and control schedules as necessary. The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should also be
responsible for key software changes as necessary.

**Special Considerations:**

* Ensure that the owner’s technical representative understands each major
  measure
* Encourage in-house technician involvement in implementation and/or have
  them implement as many measures as possible
* Document improvements in a timely manner

**Deliverables:**

CC  :sup:`SM` Report part 4: CC  :sup:`SM` Implementation. This report includes detailed documentation
of implemented operation and control sequences, maintenance procedures for
these measures, detailed O&M guidelines and additional measures recommended
for implementation.

*Step 5: Document comfort improvements and energy savings*

**Objectives:**

* Document improved comfort conditions
* Document improved system conditions
* Document improved energy performance

**Method:**

The comfort measurements taken in step 2 (Phase 2) should be repeated at the same
locations under comparable conditions to determine impact on room conditions. The
measured parameters, such as temperature and humidity, should be compared with
the measurements from step 2.

The measurements and methods adopted in step 4 should be used to determine post-
CC  :sup:`SM` energy performance. Energy performance should be compared using appropriate
occupancy and weather normalization. Typically, building energy consumption
is regressed as a function of outside air temperature if annual projections are desired
from short-term data. When hourly or daily models are used, separate models are
generally developed for weekends and weekdays.

**Special Considerations:**

* Savings analyses should follow accepted measurement and verification
  protocols such as the International Performance Measurement and Verification
  Protocol [IPMVP 2001] or an agreed upon alternate method
* Comfort conditions should conform to appropriate guidelines/design documents
  such as ASHRAE standards

**Deliverables:**

CC  :sup:`SM` Report, Part 5: Measurement and Verification. This report includes results
of detailed measurements of room conditions and energy consumption after CC  :sup:`SM`
activities, and retrofit recommendations. The room conditions and energy consumption
should be compared to those during the pre-CC  :sup:`SM` period. The annual energy
savings are projected from the available measured data.

*Step 6: Keep the Commissioning Continuous*

**Objectives:**

* Maintain improved comfort and energy performance
* Provide measured annual energy savings

**Method:**

The CC  :sup:`SM` engineers should review the system operation periodically to identify
any operating problems and develop improved operation and control schedules as
described below.

.. sidebar:: **NOTE**

   The CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should provide follow-up phone consultation to the operating
   staff as needed, supplemented by site visits. 


This will allow the operating staff to make wise decisions and maintain the savings and comfort in years to come. If long
term measured data are available, the CC  :sup:`SM` engineers should review the energy
data quarterly to evaluate the need for a site visit. If the building energy consumption
has increased, the CC  :sup:`SM` engineers determine possible reasons and verify with
facility operating staff. Once the problem(s) is identified, the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should
visit the site, develop measures to restore the building performance, and supervise
the facility staff in implementing the measures. If the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer can remotely
log into the EMCS system, the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer can check the existing system operation
quarterly using the EMCS system. When a large number of operation and
control measures are disabled, a site visit is necessary. If the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer cannot
evaluate the facility using long-term measured energy data and EMCS system information,
the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should visit the facility semi-annually.

One year after CC  :sup:`SM` implementation is complete, the CC  :sup:`SM` engineer should write
a project follow-up report that documents the first-year savings, recommendations
or changes resulting from any consultation or site visits provided, and any recommendations
to further improve building operations.

**Special Considerations:**

* Operating personnel often have a high turnover rate. It is important to
  train new staff members in the CC  :sup:`SM` process and make sure they are aware of
  the reasons the CC  :sup:`SM` measures were implemented
* Ongoing follow-up is essential if the savings are to be maintained at high levels
  over time

**Deliverables:** 
Special CC  :sup:`SM` Report, which documents measured first-year energy savings, results
from first year follow-up, recommendations for ongoing staff training, and a
schedule of follow-up CC  :sup:`SM` activities.
